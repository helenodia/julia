# Julie: A Custom Workout App

Julie is a personal training app providing custom workouts based on the userâ€™s selected target muscle group(s), desired workout time and workout goal.

This was the group project set for our final week in the [DevelopMe_ coding fellowship](https://developme.training/fellowship/).
